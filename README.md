# Problem Summary

Write a calculator program. The program should let a user enter a math problem as a string and get an answer.

# Get Started

  1. Fork and Clone the repository to your local machine.

  2. Make sure to have node.js downloaded.

  3. Cd into the directory and type `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

  4. Start the app with `npm start`. If your chrome is open, a new tab should automatically open. If not open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# Information

  - This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  - In my github, I have already done a calculator app, this is my work after having experience.

  - This is a calculator app that handles order of operations, without the use of `eval()`.

  - This app is comprised of two parts: the functionality (in `calculator.js`) and the front end (the entire app).

# General Functionality

  1. Takes string as input.

  2. Supports positive, negative, and decimal numbers.

  3. Supports +, -, *, and / operations.

  4. Supports parentheses.

# Cypress Testing

  - To run `calculator_spec.coffee`, in your terminal type `npx cypress open`

  - Cypress UI will pop up. Click on the file (calculator_spec.coffee).
